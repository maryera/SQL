# Mary Pesado's SQL Portfolio
Welcome to my repository of SQL projects! I've listed my personal SQL queries while working through a data analytics course. More to come! Feel free to reach me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marypesado/) if you have any questions. The projects' data below originates from a modified version of Synthea, a synthetic patient database.


## SQL Projects
**Patient Demographics and Healthcare Analysis** <br/>
This SQL code performs an exploratory analysis of patient data to uncover key insights into healthcare spending, income distribution, demographic trends, and patient concentration across different geographic regions.  <br/>

The analysis includes:

* **Healthcare Expenses:** Summarizes total healthcare spending by city.
* **Income and Coverage Analysis:** Evaluates income distribution and healthcare coverage across different races, focusing on disparities.
* **Demographic Insights:** Analyzes patient distribution and age averages by county, identifying regions with the youngest populations and highest patient concentrations.
* **Temporal and Racial Trends:** Examines the distribution of patients born over specific decades and compares average income, healthcare expenses, and coverage across races.

**Patient Encounter Analysis and Optimization** <br/>
This SQL code provides an in-depth analysis of patient encounter data, focusing on encounter frequency, classification, and duration. 

The analysis includes:
* **City-Level Encounter Distribution:** Counts and ranks the total number of patient encounters across different cities, identifying areas with the highest healthcare demand.
* **Encounter Classification:** Categorizes encounters by type (e.g., ambulatory, emergency) and determines their frequency, highlighting the most common types.
* **Encounter Codes Analysis:** Investigates the most frequently used medical codes and descriptions between 2020-2023, including those related to appointments, check-ups, and consultations.
* **Duration of Encounters:** Calculates the average duration of patient encounters across different encounter classes and age groups, providing insights into patient flow and care efficiency.
